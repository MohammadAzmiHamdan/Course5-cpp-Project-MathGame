# Math Quiz Game – C++ Project 🎮

## Overview
This **Math Quiz Game** is an interactive console application written in C++. It generates **random math questions** with varying difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, or Mixed) and arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division). The player answers the questions, receives **instant feedback** ✅❌, and at the end, the game shows the **final score** and pass/fail status.  

This project combines multiple C++ programming concepts in one real-world application, making it an excellent learning and portfolio project.  

## What I Learned
Through this project, I practiced and strengthened my understanding of:  
- Structs and Enums for organizing data  
- Functions for reusable logic  
- Conditional logic and loops  
- Input validation and user interaction  
- Random number generation  
- Game logic including scoring and feedback  
- System calls for screen control and alerts  

## Programming Concepts Covered

| Concept | Programming Problem Covered |
|---------|----------------------------|
| 1️⃣ Random Number Generation | Generate random numbers within a range. |
| 2️⃣ Handling User Input | Read and validate user input (integer values). |
| 3️⃣ Conditional Logic | Check correct/wrong answers and adjust scores. |
| 4️⃣ Arithmetic Operations | Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. |
| 5️⃣ Function Implementation | Write reusable functions for calculations and I/O operations. |
| 6️⃣ Working with Enums | Define and use enums for question difficulty and operations. |
| 7️⃣ Structs for Data Organization | Use `struct` to store quiz results and questions. |
| 8️⃣ String Manipulation | Convert enums into readable text. |
| 9️⃣ Looping Through Questions | Iterate over a list of questions using a loop. |
| 🔟 Conditional Formatting | Change screen color based on correct/wrong answers. |
| 1️⃣1️⃣ Validating User Input | Ensure user selects a valid difficulty and operation type. |
| 1️⃣2️⃣ Comparisons and Decision Making | Determine pass/fail conditions based on scores. |
| 1️⃣3️⃣ Function Calls and Return Values | Pass and return values between functions. |
| 1️⃣4️⃣ Generating Mixed Questions | Randomly assign question difficulty and operation type. |
| 1️⃣5️⃣ Basic AI Behavior (Computer Opponent) | Computer auto-generates questions based on difficulty. |
| 1️⃣6️⃣ Tracking Scores | Count correct and incorrect answers dynamically. |
| 1️⃣7️⃣ Screen Clearing and System Calls | Use `system("cls")` to clear the screen. |
| 1️⃣8️⃣ Playing an Alert Sound | Use `cout << "\a";` to beep on incorrect answers. |
| 1️⃣9️⃣ Working with Boolean Flags | Store and use boolean values to determine pass/fail. |
| 2️⃣0️⃣ Game Loop Logic | Implement replay logic to allow multiple quiz sessions. |
